# Interceptors

This folder contains the interceptors used in the application.

Interceptors are a powerful feature in our application that allow us to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses. They can be used for various purposes such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

## Usage

To use an interceptor, follow these steps:

1. Create a new interceptor file in this folder.
2. Implement the necessary logic in the interceptor file.
3. Register the interceptor in the application's interceptor configuration.

Here is an example of how to create and register an interceptor:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
    intercept(request: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
        // Add your interceptor logic here
        // Modify the request or response as needed
        // Return the modified request or response

        return next.handle(request);
    }
}
```

To register the interceptor, open the `app.module.ts` file and add it to the `providers` array:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule, HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
import { MyInterceptor } from './interceptors/my-interceptor';

@NgModule({
    imports: [HttpClientModule],
    providers: [
        {
            provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
            useClass: MyInterceptor,
            multi: true
        }
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

That's it! Your interceptor is now registered and will be applied to all HTTP requests made by the application.

Feel free to create and use multiple interceptors based on your application's needs.
