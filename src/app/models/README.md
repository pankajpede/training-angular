# DTOs

This folder contains the DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used in the Angular project. DTOs are used to transfer data between different layers of the application.

## File Structure

- `dto1.ts`: This file contains the definition of DTO 1.
- `dto2.ts`: This file contains the definition of DTO 2.
- `dto3.ts`: This file contains the definition of DTO 3.

## Usage

To use a DTO in your code, you can import it using the following syntax:

```typescript
import { DTO1 } from './dto1';
import { DTO2 } from './dto2';
import { DTO3 } from './dto3';
```

Make sure to replace `dto1`, `dto2`, and `dto3` with the actual names of the DTOs you want to use.
