# Pipes

This folder contains custom pipes for the Angular project.

## Overview

Pipes in Angular are used to transform data before displaying it in the template. Custom pipes can be created to perform specific data transformations based on project requirements.

## Usage

To use a custom pipe, follow these steps:

1. Import the pipe class from the respective file in this folder.
2. Add the pipe to the `declarations` array in the `@NgModule` decorator of the module where it will be used.
3. In the template, use the pipe by applying it to the desired data using the `|` symbol.

For example:

```html
<p>{{ someData | customPipe }}</p>
```

## Available Pipes

- `customPipe`: Description of what this pipe does.

Feel free to explore and use these custom pipes in your Angular project.
